# Money Exchange Simulator

This money exchange simulator utilizes D3.js and JavaScript to visualize the behavior of a model based on the following paper: [Link to the Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0001432).

## Description

The goal of this project is to provide an interactive representation of a money exchange model inspired by the linked paper. The visualization uses D3.js to create dynamic charts and deliver an interactive experience.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage Examples

Once you've opened the simulator in your browser, you can interact with the visualization to observe the behavior of the money exchange model. You can adjust parameters, explore data, and obtain detailed information about the simulation.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main file containing the HTML structure and loading necessary scripts.
- `css/style.css`: Styles for the user interface.
- `js/main.js`: JavaScript code using D3.js to create the visualization.
- `data/`: Folder that could contain necessary data for the simulation.
